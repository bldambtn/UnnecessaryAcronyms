# UnnecessaryAcronyms
A CMS-style (Content Management System) blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. Why the instructions say CMS-style instead of specifying what it mean within any part of the assignment, I don't know. Most acronyms aren't intuitive, memorable, or useful.
